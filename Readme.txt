Miscellaneous Python scripts for assistance in time saving when handling files of a specific format.
Name_Finder just outputs every single fire in as many directories and appends them to a text document, which means using CTRL+F is viable for mass file searching.

Media Sorter will copy video files into their own folder, and video files with the same name after a certain format will go into their own folder. Which is useful when sorting camera video ect...

Renamer will move files into seperate directories and partition the alphabet into even amount of letters, this is useful for larger storage options such as multiple 5tb harddrives.

The Media Sorter folder is my current work in progress. I need to learn how to make GUI's that function. Which would make not just this but all my future code more accessable for other users. Although what I make is usually very specific.
