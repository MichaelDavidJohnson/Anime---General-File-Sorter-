At the moment this code just removes all things of the form '[fijeif] ' and then moves the folders into two selected
drives in alphabetical order, 1-13 being drive one and 14-26 being drive two

Things I want to add;
Support for n many drives, will need to change the way it moves files around.
Support for appending strings to the file renamer, as in not only removing [fisj] but also adding a specific phrase to every file
Support for other generic naming - user input
interface support
